The importance of fitness has recently become apparent to me as I continue to recover from my old injuries and first pregnancy.

## What I Want to Be Able To Do
- Practice martial arts safely.
- Hike another 14ner.
- Keep up with my kids.
- Feel confident in a swimsuit.
- Avoid having to buy a new wardrobe for as long as possible.
- Take long walks through new places.
- Help out on the boat, hosting sails, etc.
- Be confident in my ability to swim if I fall overboard.
- Carry my canoe and gear through portages alone.
- Bounce back from injury and pregnancy as easily as I can make it.

### But First:
- 3 pull-ups (1 pull-up even!)
- 2 min plank
- 20 straight push-ups

## Key Areas of Improvement
- Anterior pelvic tilt, which is just beginning to cause back pain
- Old knee injury. Gotta make my joints strong.
- Cardio that’s easy on my knees.
- Rebuilding core after invasive abdominal surgery.

## Current Routines
I’m interested in “functional fitness”.
### Anterior Pelvic Tilt
*For each exercise, two 30 second reps, with as many sets you can squeeze in. 1-2 sets is most likely*
- Child’s pose
- Glute bridges with kicks
- Clamshells 
- Cat/Cow
- Plank
- Bird/Dog 
- Lunge stretches 
### Strong Knees
- Squats
- Kettlebell swings
- Calf raises
- Step up with knee raises
### Core
- Bird/Dog
- Plank
- Dead bugs
- Mountain climbers
- Side leg raises

### Flexibility
- Not really sure, sun salutation yoga flows perhaps?

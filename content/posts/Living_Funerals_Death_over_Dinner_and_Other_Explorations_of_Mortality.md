Let's put the "fun" in funeral, baby.

It's helpful to have an intentional outlet to interact and examine something as profound as death. Even better to make it a collaborative process.

Make it a party. Be upfront about what is all about. 

## What is it all about? 
It’s about being able to picture your own corpse and feel some sense of warmth or peace. It’s about being able to cordially look death in the eyes before your time comes, and to be at peace when you realize death is always in the room with you.

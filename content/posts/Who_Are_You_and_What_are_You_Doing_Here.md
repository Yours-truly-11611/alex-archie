The child of immigrant parents.
The spouse of a vagabond, learning to grow roots.
A former vagabond myself. (What does it take to have a Home?)
The parent of a young child.
Filled with wonder and hope.
A container for multitudes.
A patchwork quilt.
A discarded toy.
A stray dog.
A still pond.
A raging sea.
An alpine flower.
A ripening papaya.
I aspire to be more like the sun.
A seeker of beauty and truth, found even in dark places.

## What are you doing here then?
Learning what it earns to be alive, now.
Simply living, now. (aspirational)
Helping others live NOW.
Learning how to love better,
Falling in love with life day by day.

I want to know love and pain.

Weebs.

Yogi influencers popping up everywhere.

I myself am perilously entangled at the intersection of the „East/West“ collide as someone who is obviously of Eastern descent, yet was raised entirely in the West. I’m „2nd gen“, meaning I was the second generation born in „The New World“; my grandparents were the last generation raised in „The Old World“.

Growing up, kids and adults alike often treated me differently. Subtly, such as when I was gifted pretty chopsticks, or when everyone looked expectantly at me on Multicultural Day, and less subtly when guys said they preferred Asian women and tried pick-up lines on me in Vietnamese or Japanese. I am neither of those ethnicities, and arguably I’m not even the ethnicity I was born into; when I went back to the Homeland I was immediately identified as an outsider and targeted by scam artists.

But enough about me, on my own blog, that I am writing about myself.

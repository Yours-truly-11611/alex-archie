## Travel lightly.

## People are the same everywhere.
And by that I mean “people everywhere are kind, hospitable, and are more likely to take you in for a meal than steal your wallet.”

Everyone just wants to be treated with respect. Everyone enjoys being listened to. Everyone enjoys teaching others about something they love.

**Always treat everyone with compassion.**

But that doesn’t mean trust everyone blindly. There are also rascals in every country.

## Expect the best, plan for the worst.

## You’re a fool.
And don’t try to act otherwise. No matter how well educated you are or how much status you have at home, it means nothing when you have to ask a stranger how to flush the toilet.

Don’t be afraid to look stupid. You can’t know everything, especially when you just arrive somewhere. In fact, it puts others at ease to be able to humble yourself, and it allows you to learn about the lives of others in ways that would otherwise be closed to you.

## You will be drawn to adventure stores at home and furniture stores abroad.

## Find wonder in little things.

## One selfless gesture sparks another.

## The world is as safe or as dangerous as you let it be.

## When you are responsible for yourself and no one else, you shape up quickly.

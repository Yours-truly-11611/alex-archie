I love travelling light. I also love getting dolled up when I visit a city. But so many one-bag travel blogs condemn bringing luxuries like a pair of heels or more than one dress.

Not this one!

I travelled for 2 years out of one 32 L backpack with a pair of heels and 2 dresses, while also being prepared for several months working on farmstays and homesteads.

This is a practical and tested guide to dressing confidently on the road while keeping your backpack bulk down.

## The Mindset
Before you begin packing at all you have to settle with the idea that 
 1. you can’t bring everything and
 2. if you truly need something, you’ll find it away from home.

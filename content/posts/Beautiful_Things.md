![A list of beautiful things](/images/2025/11/Gratitude.jpg)


*2025 December 13*
- I have a working washing machine!
- I have all the little comforts and luxuries that I have ever wanted, like a pc to play games on, a washing machine and dryer, an e-reader, enough art supplies to satisfy my creative urges, a garden, city amenities, a gym membership, clothes I feel comfortable and confident in, a dishwasher, and an over the sink drying rack.

*2025 December 12, Friday*
- We have a microwave. Didn’t have one for several years.
- Public libraries
- Big, fat, perfect snowflakes that glitter like shards of glass.

*2025 December 10*
- Miniature train displays in local shop windows.
- It’s relatively easy to fly and see family (not cheap, but not as expensive as it could be).

- The daycare folks complimented the consistently tasty-looking snacks that I pack for S—.
- The grocery store is walking distance away, even in winter.
- Pears and papayas are a good price.
- Every Saturday and Wednesday, the local farmer’s market is up.
- The local farmer’s market is actually a farmer’s market and not an expensive-craft-doodad market.

*2025 December 7, Sunday*

*2025 November 7*

En route to Toronto.

Somehow I forgot my coat in the middle of Canadian winter. Thankfully there are several folks at our destination that share the same sizing as me; I’ll borrow one.

Current books: Frankenstein, Roald Dahl‘s Collected Short Stories, Denial of Death

Current jams: I Love My Computer by Ninajirachi

What’s new this time:
- S- is old enough to have his own seat.
- I brought a tablet with predownloaded movies.
- We checked a bag since we will be gone for over a month between two very different climates. I’ll exercise a more minimal approach for non-holiday travel.
- A checked bag means no more carry-on; a big plus since reaching into overhead bins is difficult for my petite frame.

Having two separate seats instead of sharing one is a highly anticipated improvement that has lived up to the hype. Both of us are much happier.

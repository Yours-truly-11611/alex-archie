## Pets shouldn’t be treated like people.
They can still be treated respectfully, as pets, but worrying about hurting their feelings by not including them at the table, for example,  is going too far.
„This is my baby!“ No, that’s your dog.
„She’s family; don’t exclude her.“ No, that’s a cat on the table with paws that were just scratching poop in a box.
Why do people need to coddle their pets? Why not spend that energy trying to spoil your human friends?
## Suicide isn’t always bad, and is in fact the favourable and honourable outcome sometimes.
I say this as someone who is not currently suicidal, but who was for a long time, and as somebody who has lost friends to suicide.
Don’t just try to fix the mental illness; fix the world this person has to exist in on a daily basis
## People should preserve quality of life rather than life for life’s sake.
Don’t keep grandma or mom on life support for years. What an awful existence, and by your selfish actions. Death is not the ultimate enemy.
## You are not entitled to your opinion.
You are only entitled to opinions you’ve actually examined.
The about of times I’ve asked „why do you think that,“ or „why do you feel that way,“ and they’re unable to answer me straight.
## Gossip isn’t bad.
It’s a neutral tool that can be used for good or bad.

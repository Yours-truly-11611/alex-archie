      <description>&lt;p&gt;Right now, it is December 2025, in the midst of the second Trump administration. I live in Canada. Criticizing the USA and it’s inhabitants is as easy and as common as talking about the weather. Wearing any semblance of Stars and Stripes flags you as some kind of bigot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not a fan of the president, but I am also reluctant to condemn him or his supporters, and I am certainly stubbornly hopeful for the future of my home country.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        </header>
        <section class="post-content">
            <p><p>I was 22 when I first visited the Philippines. The country where my father was born, and where all of my ancestors had lived before my grandparents moved to the New World, the Land of Opportunity— the United States.</p>
<p>The first reckoning was before I had even left the airport terminal. “FILIPINOS,” one aisle was marked with in bold capital letters. “NON-FILIPINOS,” said the other. I stood between the two as the other passengers filed past me, confidently choosing the line they belonged in. Of course this was about what kind of passport I held, but in my sleep-deprived state it seemed like a question that rocked my very essence. My American passport suddenly felt foreign to me, despite it being my constant companion for the last several years. It named my origin, but could I claim it? After a halted breath, I chose the “Non-Filipino” line, and with each step forward, I felt the weight of that choice.</p></p>

        </header>
        <section class="post-content">
            <p><p>I love travelling light. I also love getting dolled up when I visit a city. But so many one-bag travel blogs condemn bringing luxuries like a pair of heels or more than one dress.</p>
<p>Not this one!</p>
<p>I travelled for 2 years out of one 32 L backpack with a pair of heels and 2 dresses, while also being prepared for several months working on farmstays and homesteads. Packing one bag for such a wide range of scenarios simply requires careful planning, choice, a little sacrifice, and creativity. All without sacrificing style!</p></p>

            <p><p>Here are the books I completed in 2025. (Work in Progress)</p>
<p>I was surprised to see that I only finished 3 books that are fiction/sci-fi. Many more were started, including a book of Roland Dahl’s short stories and a collection by Terry Pratchet, but I have yet to finish the whole book so they’ll go on next year’s list.</p>

<p>I loved how the writing style evolved and changed as the character’s mental capacity grew and shrank. Didn’t like how he wrote the women characters, but that style is pretty standard for the time, so I don’t hold it against him. Great story and concept.</p></p>

            <p><p><em>Isn’t keeping a blog a bit… egocentric?</em></p>
<p>I mean it could be but it doesn’t have to be. What matters is the purpose. For instance, I blog as a means to reclaim my online experience. I don’t post so much on social media because I have this space that’s completely mine- no tracking, to ads, no weird internet politics. I built this thing myself so I know exactly what’s going on behind the scenes. You can’t say that about any social media site or really anything else if you didn’t build it yourself.</p></p>

            <p><p>Let&rsquo;s put the &ldquo;fun&rdquo; in funeral, baby.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s helpful to have an intentional outlet to interact and examine something as profound as death. Even better to make it a collaborative process.</p>
<p>Make it a party. Or maybe a cozy potluck.
(This article is still being heavily edited while I figure out what I want/need to do.)</p>
<h2 id="what-is-it-all-about">What is it all about?</h2>
<p>It’s about being able to picture your own corpse and feel some sense of warmth or peace. It’s about being able to cordially look death in the eyes before your time comes, and to be at peace when you realize death is always in the room with you.</p></p>
